"""kernel_replay.py — sequentially replay a captured kernel build.

Phase 1 PoC. Reads build_plan.json and re-executes captured exec records
in their original timestamp order to reproduce the build outputs.

Replay strategy: only replay records whose parent process was `make`
(either an explicit `make` exec in the trace, or the implicit outer
`make` we launched). Drop `make` execs themselves. This avoids double-
execution of nested processes (e.g., cc forks cc1/as/ld internally —
those are captured too, but cc's replay will fork them again on its own).

Path stability: replay assumes the build_tree is at the same absolute
path it was at capture time. Source must be pre-staged there. (Phase 3
will introduce relocatable replay for Buck integration.)

Usage:
    kernel_replay.py --plan /tmp/cap/build_plan.json \
                     --source-dir /path/to/linux \
                     --config /path/to/.config \
                     [--fresh]
