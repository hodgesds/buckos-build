# Emulation and Virtualization packages
#
# This category contains software for:
# - System emulation (QEMU, Xen)
# - Desktop virtualization (VirtualBox, libvirt, virt-manager)
# - Container runtimes (Docker, Podman, containerd)
# - Lightweight virtualization (Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor, crosvm)
# - Kernel development tools (virtme-ng, kvmtool)
# - VM utilities (SPICE, virtiofsd)
